## About the Project
The landing page is designed with a focus on a high-tech "Glassmorphism" aesthetic, combining transparency, blur effects, and vibrant gradients.

### Key Features:
* **Glassmorphism UI**: Advanced use of `backdrop-filter`, inner shadows, and semi-transparent layers.
* **Pixel Perfect**: Precise implementation based on the original Figma mockup.
* **Fluid Typography**: Leveraging the CSS `clamp()` function for seamless font scaling across all device sizes.
* **Responsive Design**: Fully optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
* **Custom Form Elements**: Styled checkboxes, custom select menus, and interactive hover states.
